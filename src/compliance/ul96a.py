UL 96A Standard for Lightning Protection Systems

This module encodes the rules from UL 96A. These rules determine:
- Where air terminals (lightning rods) must be placed
- How conductors (cables) must be routed
- Grounding requirements

Think of this as the "rulebook" that tells us the minimum requirements.

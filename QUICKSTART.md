# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - LightningBid

## What Just Happened?

You successfully built and ran an **automated lightning protection bidding system**! Here's what it does:

1. ‚úÖ Loads pricing data (from Excel or demo data)
2. ‚úÖ Scans project specs (from PDFs)
3. ‚úÖ Calculates compliance requirements (UL 96A or NFPA 780)
4. ‚úÖ Generates professional bid packages (Excel + PDF)

## Your First Run

You just ran the system and it created:

üìä **Excel Bid Sheet** (`bid_Sample_Office_Building_-_Lightning_Protection.xlsx`)
- Sheet 1: Bill of Materials (detailed item list)
- Sheet 2: Cost Summary (totals by section)
- Sheet 3: Final Bid (with markup and profit)

üìÑ **PDF Submittal** (`submittal_Sample_Office_Building_-_Lightning_Protection.pdf`)
- Professional cover page
- Compliance certifications
- Material list

**Check them out in:** `data/outputs/`

## How to Run It Again

```bash
py -m src.main
```

That's it! Super simple.

## Next Steps

### 1. Understand the Code Flow

Open `src/main.py` and read through it. It's well-commented and shows the complete workflow:

```
Load Pricing ‚Üí Parse Specs ‚Üí Calculate Compliance ‚Üí Generate Bid ‚Üí Export Files
```

### 2. Customize Project Data

In `src/main.py` around line 88, you'll find:

```python
project_data = {
    "project_name": "Sample Office Building - Lightning Protection",
    "building_height_ft": 35.0,
    "roof_area_sqft": 5000.0,
    # ... more fields
}
```

**Try changing these values!** For example:
- Change `building_height_ft` to `50.0` (taller building)
- Change `roof_area_sqft` to `10000.0` (larger roof)
- Run again and see how the bid changes

### 3. Switch Compliance Codes

Around line 104 in `main.py`:

```python
compliance_code = "UL 96A"  # Change to "NFPA 780"
```

**Try switching to NFPA 780** and see how requirements differ!

### 4. Adjust Pricing

In `main.py` around line 72, the demo pricing is defined:

```python
PriceItem(code="AT-001", name="Air Terminal - Copper",
          unit="ea", unit_price=45.00, labor_rate=15.00)
```

**Try changing prices:**
- Increase `unit_price` to `60.00`
- Increase `labor_rate` to `20.00`
- Run again and watch the final bid amount change

### 5. Adjust Markup Percentages

In `src/models/bid.py` around line 25:

```python
material_markup_pct: float = 15.0  # 15% markup
labor_markup_pct: float = 20.0     # 20% markup
overhead_pct: float = 10.0
profit_pct: float = 10.0
```

Change these to match your business model!

## Understanding Key Files

### üìÅ `src/models/` - Data Structures

- `items.py` - What a pricing item looks like (code, name, price)
- `project.py` - Project information (building details, requirements)
- `bid.py` - Complete bid with costs and sections

**Think of these as templates/blueprints for organizing data**

### üìÅ `src/adapters/` - Input Parsers

- `excel_loader.py` - Reads Excel pricing sheets
- `pdf_loader.py` - Extracts info from PDF specs

**These are "translators" that convert Excel/PDF ‚Üí Python objects**

### üìÅ `src/compliance/` - Code Standards

- `ul96a.py` - UL 96A rules (20 ft spacing, etc.)
- `nfpa780.py` - NFPA 780 rules (25 ft spacing, bonding)

**These encode the "rulebooks" that determine what's needed**

### üìÅ `src/calculator/` - Bid Engine

- `bid_calc.py` - The "brain" that maps requirements ‚Üí pricing

**This is where compliance requirements meet pricing data**

### üìÅ `src/exporters/` - Output Generators

- `excel_export.py` - Creates formatted Excel workbooks
- `pdf_export.py` - Creates professional PDFs

**These turn bid data into beautiful documents**

## Common Customizations

### Change Contractor Info

In `main.py` around line 127:

```python
pdf_exporter = PDFSubmittalExporter(
    contractor_name="ABC Lightning Protection Co.",  # Your company name
    contractor_info={
        "address": "123 Main St, Your City, ST 12345",  # Your address
        "phone": "(555) 123-4567",  # Your phone
        "email": "info@abclightning.com",  # Your email
        "license": "LP-12345"  # Your license number
    }
)
```

**Update this with your real company info!**

### Add More Materials to Demo Catalog

In `main.py` around line 72, add more items:

```python
PriceItem(code="SPLICE-01", name="Cable Splice",
          unit="ea", unit_price=12.50, labor_rate=8.00)
```

## Learning the Compliance Rules

### UL 96A Quick Summary

Open `src/compliance/ul96a.py` and read the comments:

```python
AIR_TERMINAL_MAX_SPACING = 20  # Air terminals ‚â§20 ft apart
GROUND_ROD_MIN_DEPTH = 10      # Ground rods ‚â•10 ft deep
```

**Key Rules:**
- Air terminals every 20 ft max on roof edges
- Minimum 2 down conductors (two-way path to ground)
- 8 inch minimum bend radius for conductors
- Ground rods at least 10 ft deep

### NFPA 780 Quick Summary

Open `src/compliance/nfpa780.py`:

```python
AIR_TERMINAL_MAX_SPACING = 25  # Slightly more lenient
```

**Key Differences from UL 96A:**
- Allows 25 ft spacing (vs 20 ft)
- Additional bonding requirements for metal objects
- Ground ring system recommended for large structures

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'pandas'"

You need to install dependencies:

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Excel file not loading

The current Excel loader works with simple pricing sheets. Your actual Excel file (`ULP BID SHEET 2022.xlsx`) has a complex format.

**Two options:**
1. **Use demo mode** (what you're doing now) - fine for learning
2. **Customize the Excel loader** - edit `src/adapters/excel_loader.py` to match your Excel structure

### Want to see what's in the Excel?

Open it in Excel and look at which row the headers are on, what they're named, etc. Then update the loader accordingly.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Change Building Size

Modify `project_data` in `main.py`:
- Building height: 60 ft
- Roof area: 8000 sqft
- Perimeter: 360 ft

Run the system. **How did the bid amount change?**

### Exercise 2: Price Increase

In the demo pricing, increase all prices by 20%. Run again.

**Question:** By how much did the final bid increase? (Hint: it's not 20% because of markup and profit!)

### Exercise 3: UL 96A vs NFPA 780

Run the system twice:
1. First with `compliance_code = "UL 96A"`
2. Then with `compliance_code = "NFPA 780"`

**Compare the outputs:** Which requires more air terminals? Why?

### Exercise 4: Add a New Material

Add a new PriceItem to the demo catalog:

```python
PriceItem(code="SURGE-01", name="Surge Protector",
          unit="ea", unit_price=125.00, labor_rate=30.00)
```

This won't automatically appear in bids yet - you'd need to add logic in `bid_calc.py` to include it. But you're learning the structure!

## Getting Help

### Read the Code Comments

Every file has detailed comments explaining what it does:

```python
"""
This is a docstring - it explains what the module/function does.
Read these first!
"""
```

### Understand One File at a Time

Don't try to understand everything at once. Pick one file and read it thoroughly:

1. Start with `src/models/items.py` (simple!)
2. Then `src/compliance/ul96a.py` (has calculations)
3. Then `src/calculator/bid_calc.py` (brings it together)

### Use Print Statements for Debugging

Add print statements to see what's happening:

```python
print(f"DEBUG: quantity = {quantity}, price = {price}")
```

### Run Small Tests

Create a test file to experiment:

```python
# test.py
from src.models.items import PriceItem

item = PriceItem(code="TEST", name="Test Item", unit_price=10.0)
print(f"Item: {item.name} costs ${item.unit_price}")
```

Run it: `py test.py`

## Key Takeaways

1. **Software is just data + transformations**
   - Input data (Excel, PDFs) ‚Üí Process (calculations) ‚Üí Output data (Excel, PDFs)

2. **Break complex problems into small pieces**
   - Each module does ONE thing well
   - Chain them together for complex workflows

3. **Code is meant to be read and understood**
   - Comments explain WHY
   - Variable names explain WHAT
   - Structure shows HOW

4. **It's OK to not understand everything**
   - Focus on the parts you need
   - Google unfamiliar concepts
   - Experiment and learn by doing

## Congratulations! üéâ

You've built a real, working software system that:
- Reads multiple file types
- Applies complex business rules
- Generates professional outputs
- Saves hours of manual work

**This is impressive work for a college senior!** Keep building, keep learning, and don't be afraid to break things and try again.
